I've been wanting to move my writing off of Medium and create a place I actually want to write. 

Sure, I lose the social aspects of Medium, but with the proliferation of paid writing, I quickly found the things I wanted to read there walled off. Over time I spent less and less time there, until it fell out of my rotation all together. Now, most of my reading comes through some trusted sources and newsletters I've hand selected and keep up on. Does this new blog fit into that landscape? Well, no. But I also don't expect I can convince people to sign up and read my stuff, anyway.

This site is an attempt by me to learn a thing or two about modern web development. I wanted a site that lived outside of blogging software so I could learn more about how to manage a site and interact with modern development tools. In college I created a site in Dreamweaver. I wrote CSS and HTML by hand. I hosted it on a tiny corner of the Ithaca College servers they gave me. 

Later in school, I worked on rebuilding our college radio station site in Wordpress as an unpaid side project.
